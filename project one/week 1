### Week one

### lesson 1 to 3
there is three ways to code css
first is to open an external css file using link
secont is to write a css code in the html page inside {style}
third is to write a css code insid the element itself like thid;
<p style ="color : red "> this is cs50 </p>
the differnce

### lesson 4 
 name conventions and rules
the same as naming of virables 
 the best practice in css is to use (-) in between we name it kabeb case
 # like this num-1 or type-c

### lesson 5
background and color and inage ane repeat

there is three ways to choose a color for a background
1 you can type its name 
2 you can use RGB the higher number is 255 and the lowest is 0
3 using hexdesimol the highset is ff and the lowest is 0
#to use the third opion start with #

background image
background-image: url (../ back step to reach a last folder)
                     (/to open a folder)
                     background repeat: repeat; 3 it reapeats the same image right to lift top to 
                     bottom
                                       : repeat x # repeats the image left to right
                                       : repeat y # repeats the image top to bottom

### lesson 6 
background attachment and position and size
background
background attachment`s default mode is scroll
that means the background will still in its place and will never move even when you scroll
but if you want the background to move as you move use #fixed 

background position  
there is many ways to situp the background position 
first; top or bottom left right and center# if you did not write one of the values it is gonna be center by default
second ; by px ex; 100px 300px
third ; by  ex 20% 56%
 
 background size ; 
 1. auto ; makes the backgroun on its normal size #default value
 2. cover ; full size on all the contant and it code be cut 
 3. contain ; full size also but it never be cut and you can give it  px px and % %

### lesson 7 
padding
الهوامش
padding also takes 4 values but if you did not wite some vilue its gonna have it from the one in front to it and if you wrote only one value it is goona be applayed on the four sides
ex padding : 10px 30px ; # it can be written in %
if you want to make padding for only one side 
ex padding top : 10px
the padding does not accept negative value

### leson 8
margin
الهوامش الخارجية
just like padding when speaking on values % and px and sides
margin does accept negative value
if you gave the elment width of 40% for ex 
the element is gonna be on the right side and the other 60 % is gonna be margin
if you want your elemnt to be centered 
margin-left:30%
margin-right :30%
and also you can do it like this
margin-left: auto;
margin-right :auto;
and there is an easier way
margin:auto;

### lesson 9
border
border-width:2px; # that mean the border has width for all sides 
border-width:2px 3px; # that mean the border has width for top and right sides 
##that mean its like the padding and margin it takes four values
so...
border-width:10px; ## takes for values
border-color:green; ## takes for values
border-style:solid; ## takes for values some styles : dashed dotted double groove   hidded inherit inset none outset ervert ridge solid unset
 ## code short cut
 border:20px green solid ; 

 ### lesson 10
 outline #lookes like border but it is not
         # you cant give valu for every side
         # the border addes to the width of the element but the outline does not
         # what you add to outline is litterly outline the element
outline-style: 10px solied red;          

### lesson 11
display , block, inline ,inline-block

# block
takes the full width if there is no width
adds line break
and it respect padding and margin
# inline
does not add line break
does not respect width and hight
do respect pading and margin but from left and right only
allows the elements befor and after it
# display 
changes the block into inline and the otherwise is correct and it change also into inline-block
# inline block
allows the elements befor and after it
do respect pading and margin but from left and right only


### lesson 12 
element visibility and use cases

# display 
display values : block ; inline ; inline-block ; none # hide the element and remove its place from the page
visibility : visible ; # visible is the default value
visibility : hidden;  # hide the element asso like display none but keeps its place ecxist
