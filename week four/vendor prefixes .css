 to use a new feature even beftor the browsers support
 the new feature 
 and afer the feature is being suported in the new 
 version of the browser there is gonna be
 no need for prefix anymore
 this is how you add prefix

    -webkit-somefeature:0px;
    -moz-somefeature:0px;
    -o-somefeature:0px;

-webkit-  : chrom , safari , new oprea version
-moz-     : firefox
-ms-      : ie , edge
-o-       : old verson of oprea
