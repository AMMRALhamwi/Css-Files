/*  static position
# its the defualt value and it makes the 
element static in its place and never move

# relative posintion 
moves obove the other elements and it takes negative value

# absolute position
the element goes out of the work flow and it looks like the 
elemnt is not in the page so the other elements might sit under it
 
and now its parent is the page unless you give it another parent
but the parent should have relative position or its not gonna work

# fixed position
moves depending on the page regaredless on its current position
and gets down the page as long you scroll

# sticky postion
stays in its place untile you start scrolling after that it stays in 
the top of the page
but you have to to tell it that for ex
position:sticky;
top:0; or any number
